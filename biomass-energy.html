                            Biomass energy significantly reduces net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared to fossil fuels.
                            The carbon dioxide released during the combustion or conversion of biomass is offset by the
                            CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed by plants during their growth phase, creating a balanced carbon
                            cycle. Unlike fossil fuels, which release carbon that has been stored for millions of years,
                            biomass utilizes carbon that is currently in the atmosphere. Furthermore, biomass combustion
                            emits fewer harmful pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides
                            (NO<sub>x</sub>), which contribute to acid rain and air pollution. Therefore, biomass serves
                            as a cleaner energy source that helps mitigate the impacts of climate change while improving
                            air quality.

                            Anaerobic digestion is a biological process that breaks down organic matter, such as
                            agricultural waste, food scraps, and animal manure, in the absence of oxygen. This process
                            is facilitated by microorganisms that convert the biomass into biogas—a mixture of methane
                            and carbon dioxide—and digestate, a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer. The anaerobic
                            digestion process typically occurs in a digester, where conditions such as temperature and
                            pH are controlled to optimize microbial activity. The produced biogas can be captured and
                            used for electricity generation, heating, or upgraded to biomethane for use as a vehicle
                            fuel or injection into the natural gas grid.
