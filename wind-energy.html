                    <div class="para">Wind energy is generated by converting the kinetic energy from wind into
                        mechanical power, which is then used to produce electricity. Wind turbines, the primary
                        technology used for this purpose, consist of large blades that capture wind energy and spin a
                        rotor connected to a generator. The movement of the blades creates mechanical energy, which the
                        generator converts into electrical energy. Wind is a renewable resource, replenished by the
                        sun's heating of the Earth's surface, atmospheric circulation, and the rotation of the planet.
                        As long as the sun shines and the wind blows, we can harness wind energy. It is a clean and
                        sustainable way to meet our energy needs without depleting natural resources or polluting the
                        environment.

                                diameters apart—can limit the total number of turbines that can be installed in a given
                                area. This spacing is essential to reduce the wake effect, where one turbine disrupts
                                the wind flow for others nearby. Furthermore, HAWTs are sensitive to wind turbulence
                                caused by nearby obstacles such as trees or buildings, which can lead to inefficiencies
                                and increased wear on turbine components. Therefore, careful site selection and wind
                                resource assessment are critical to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the

                                reduces structural stress, making them less susceptible to high winds and storms. Their
                                compact size allows them to be installed in smaller spaces, such as rooftops or in urban
                                settings, where traditional HAWTs may not be feasible. Furthermore, maintenance is
                                generally simpler due to their lower height; technicians can access components without
                                the need for specialized equipment like cranes. This ease of maintenance can lead to
                                lower operational costs over time, making VAWTs an attractive option for small-scale
                                installations.</div>

                                applications. While VAWTs can effectively capture wind energy, their efficiency
                                typically ranges from 30% to 40%, which can make them less competitive compared to
                                HAWTs, especially in large-scale projects. This limitation means they are often best
                                suited for smaller-scale applications or as supplemental power sources in hybrid systems
                                that integrate multiple forms of renewable energy. Additionally, the market for VAWTs is
                                less mature, resulting in fewer manufacturers and less ongoing research into performance
                                optimization. Innovations in VAWT design are essential to improve efficiency and broaden
